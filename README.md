# README

## 8 key requirements:

- 3+ distinct visual scenes (with distinct “Scene” classes)
> studio name scene

> cat jumpscare scene

> menu scene

- 2+ audio assets (e.g. background music and a sound effect)
> vine-boom-By-tuna.voicemod.net

> cristiano-ronaldo-siiuuu-earrape-By-tuna.voicemod.net

- 2+ image assets (one with transparent background)
> catw.png (transparent bg)

> cat.png

> "catw" was drawn in Photoshop and "cat" was drawn in MS Paint. I wanted the two images to be as messy as possible to add on to the scare factor.

- 2+ geometric shapes (rendered in-engine)
> 3 circles

- 1+ big fancy text (composed out of engine)
> title.png

> The title text was created using MS Paint fonts.

- 1+ multi-line text (rendered in-engine)
> menu options

- 1+ fading scene transition (e.g. fade to black)
> each scene transitions using fadeOut

- 1+ object motion animation (e.g. sliding in from the side)
> cat.png scales/zooms out
